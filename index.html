				The F35B has vertical take-off and landing capabilities like a helicopter.  This allows it to be launched from small WASP class aircraft carriers designed usually just for helicopters.  With the ability to launch F-35s, these WASP-class vessels will be able to destroy anti-aircraft missile sites (due to it's stealth) and destroy enemy radar cababilities for hundreds of miles inland.  Paired with Osprey transport vehicles a WASP-class boat can now penetrate the most advanced defenses from sea hundreds of miles inland with little risk.

				There have been a lot of negative reviews about the dogfighting capabilities of the f-35.  It was unable to destroy much older aircraft during tests.  However, the pilots in the older aircraft had over 25,000 hours flight time compared to the 2,000 of the pilot in the f-35.  Also, most importantly, no aircraft has been able to even lock on to an f-35.  This is the real point of the f-35's dogfighting capabilities: the ability to not require an air escort for close support missions the way, say, an a-10 warthog would.  It is able to launch from a small WASP and eliminate radar and SAM targets without air escort.  It is the one tool to rule them all.

				<li>1940's era radar can detect even the most advanced stealth aircraft from a long distance and with accuracy</li>
				<li>these old-style radars are mobile and get more advanced every year </li>
				<li>These radar cannot guide weapons which is stealth's most important quality</li>
				<li> Stealth is for pilot and plane safety, not for avoiding detection.</li>

				<div class="F">
					Modern warfare is basically being able to fire on your enemy without them being able to fire at you.  Many nay-sayers of stealth argue that there are cheap, vast, mobile, reliable radar all over the world (even undeveloped countries) that can detect any stealth aircraft.  But who cares?  What good is it to know an enemy-aircraft is there without being able to do anything about it?  All the while that enemy-aircraft is destroying your anti-air defense system. 
				</div>

				<div class="J">
					
						Sounds like that's one hell of an enemy-aircraft?  But that's nothing compared to the whole story...
				</div>

				<div class="D">
					
						Imagine if when you send even your best 5th-generation fighter jets (J-31/China, T-50/Russia, F-22/USA) those jets are unable to harm that enemy-aircraft in a dogfight.  Your SAMs can't target it because of the afore-mentioned stealth.  You literally can't hurt it.
				</div>

				<div class="D">
					
						...it can carry 6x 2000-lb bombs along with 2 air-to-surface missiles while in stealth and while able to defend itself against any 5th-generation jet making it an invulnerable bomber (for destroying SAM targets and sensors so Osprey's and helicopters can come in) and ground support tool.
				</div>

				<div class="D">
					...it has a GAU-22/A cannon with 220x 25mm rounds.  This provides a few short bursts of close-air-support (attacking tanks, armored vehicles, ground troops in fortifications) rounds.  So this aircraft can sweep an area and safely clear-out all of the SAMs, tanks/armored-vehicles, fortified ground troops, and air-superiority-jets (the 5th-generation jets mentioned before), without risking loss of life or equipment.  This clears the way for transport vehicles (Osprey baby!) and helicopters...
				</div>

				<div class="D">
					...and the best part: it doesn't need any kind of base or billion dollar nuclear aircraft carrier (expensive to operate and there are only 10 American one's on Earth) to operate from.  It can take off and land from any aircraft boat, even the tiny WASP class carriers.  This means it makes every tiny aircraft carrying boat in our fleet as capable as an supercarrier.  This spreads out our assets and essentially quadruples the number of spercarrier-capable assault ships in our navy.
				</div>
				<div class="D">
					The other aspect of having the US and its allies use all use the same plane is that the F-35 talks to other F-35s to compile intelligence about the battlefield.  The more F-35s there are out there the larger the collective battle intel will be.  It is this intel that the US (not China or Russia who both invested in building smaller dogfighting aircraft similar to the F-15 eagle) believes will determine air supperiority in the future.  In tests where combatants start beyond visual range (which is how every real-life situation wil start) no legacy aircraft on earth can even see the F-35 before they are destroyed.  The US is correct: modern warfare will be based on intelligence, secure networking for sharing intelligence, and beyond visual range combat.
				</div>		 
				<div class="D">
					This is the beauty of the f-35B.  Is what is does for our Navy and Marines.
