				The F35B has vertical take-off and landing capabilities like a helicopter.  This allows it to be launched from small WASP class aircraft carriers designed usually just for helicopters.  With the ability to launch F-35s, these WASP-class vessels will be able to destroy anti-aircraft missile sites (due to it's stealth) and destroy enemy radar cababilities for hundreds of miles inland.  Paired with Osprey transport vehicles a WASP-class boat can now penetrate the most advanced defenses from sea hundreds of miles inland with little risk.

				There have been a lot of negative reviews about the dogfighting capabilities of the f-35.  It was unable to destroy much older aircraft during tests.  However, the pilots in the older aircraft had over 25,000 hours flight time compared to the 2,000 of the pilot in the f-35.  Also, most importantly, no aircraft has been able to even lock on to an f-35.  This is the real point of the f-35's dogfighting capabilities: the ability to not require an air escort for close support missions the way, say, an a-10 warthog would.  It is able to launch from a small WASP and eliminate radar and SAM targets without air escort.  It is the one tool to rule them all.

				<div class="F">
					Modern warfare is basically being able to fire on your enemy without them being able to fire at you.  Many nay-sayers of stealth argue that there are cheap, vast, mobile, reliable radar all over the world (even undeveloped countries) that can detect any stealth aircraft.  But who cares?  What good is it to know an enemy-aircraft is there without being able to do anything about it?  All the while that enemy-aircraft is destroying your anti-air defense system. 
				</div>

				<div class="J">
					
						Sounds like that's one hell of an enemy-aircraft?  But that's nothing compared to the whole story...
				</div>

				<div class="D">
					
						Imagine if when you send even your best 5th-generation fighter jets (J-31/China, T-50/Russia, F-22/USA) those jets are unable to harm that enemy-aircraft in a dogfight.  Your SAMs can't target it because of the afore-mentioned stealth.  You literally can't hurt it.
				</div>

				<div class="D">
					
						...it can carry 6x 2000-lb bombs along with 2 air-to-surface missiles while in stealth and while able to defend itself against any 5th-generation jet making it an invulnerable bomber (for destroying SAM targets and sensors so Osprey's and helicopters can come in) and ground support tool.
				</div>

				<div class="D">
					...it has a GAU-22/A cannon with 220x 25mm rounds.  This provides a few short bursts of close-air-support (attacking tanks, armored vehicles, ground troops in fortifications) rounds.  So this aircraft can sweep an area and safely clear-out all of the SAMs, tanks/armored-vehicles, fortified ground troops, and air-superiority-jets (the 5th-generation jets mentioned before), without risking loss of life or equipment.  This clears the way for transport vehicles (Osprey baby!) and helicopters...
				</div>

				<div class="D">
					...and the best part: it doesn't need any kind of base or billion dollar nuclear aircraft carrier (expensive to operate and there are only 10 American one's on Earth) to operate from.  It can take off and land from any aircraft boat, even the tiny WASP class carriers.  This means it makes every tiny aircraft carrying boat in our fleet as capable as an supercarrier.  This spreads out our assets and essentially quadruples the number of spercarrier-capable assault ships in our navy.
				</div>
				<div class="H">
					The other aspect of having the US and its allies use all use the same plane is that the F-35 talks to other F-35s to compile intelligence about the battlefield.  The more F-35s there are out there the larger the collective battle intel will be.  It is this intel that the US (not China or Russia who both invested in building smaller dogfighting aircraft similar to the F-15 eagle) believes will determine air supperiority in the future.  In tests where combatants start beyond visual range (which is how every real-life situation wil start) no legacy aircraft on earth can even see the F-35 before they are destroyed.  The US is correct: modern warfare will be based on intelligence, secure networking for sharing intelligence, and beyond visual range combat.
				</div>		 
				<div class="H">
					This is the beauty of the f-35B.  Is what is does for our Navy and Marines.

		<h2>Comparisons to the F4 Phantom</h2>
		<h3>The First 'Universal' Fighter</h3>
		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/RmqjaKx.jpg">
		<figcaption>An F4 Phantom with F35 in background</figcaption>

		<div>
			<h4>The Power of General Electric J-79s</h4>
			The F4 Phantom was designed to be the Navy's new fleet defense interceptor, not a nimble dogfighter (the navy was happy with its primary dogfighter the F-8 Crusader).  However, despite the F4's bloated body, the prototype quickly beat the latest Crusader variant in ariel superiority.  This is almost entirely because it had two massive (and ULTRA famous) General Electric J-79 jet motors.  This set-up led to aviation experts to coin the phrase "You can make a brick fly if you put a big enough engine on it."  This brick set 16 avaition world records (speed, height, endurance...).


			and ground attack jet [Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]) 


			
		<div>
			<H4>Navy, Marines, Air Force go all-in</H4>
			The F4 Phantom took over air superiority in the navy almost from the jump.  Then the Phantom took over bombing missions due to its speed, independence from air-superiority escorts, and endurance.  This versitility lead the marine corps to, in 1962, buy F4 Phantoms for air protection.  The jets versatility lead them to purchase many more as ground support jets.  The air force jumped on board for the same reasons of versatility (ability to perform air-superiority missions as well as ground-support/bombing missions) and unGodly thrust from the J-79s.
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>Percieved Failures</h4>
			The F4 Phantom was most exensively used in the Vietnam War where it only achieved a 4:1 kill ratio against the weaker Russian MiG, some months actually having a negative kill ratio.  Compare that the its replacement the F-15 Eagle which has never lost a single plane ever.  This bad kill ratio against smaller faster craft is exactly what F35 haters fear, that this bloated 'jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none' fighter/bomber is going to get embarassed against much more agile enemy aircraft (J20 from China and T50 from Russia).  But what is missing from this story is that, like the F35, the F4 Phantom was designed to launch air-to-air missiles beyond visual range as its main air-to-air combat.  In the Vietnam war, beyond-visual-range fighting was illegal.  So the F4 was forced to play the MiGs game and forced into maximum weakness and still had a 4:1 kill ratio.  Outside the restrictions of Vietnam, the F4 was the world's superior air fighter until replaced by the F-14 Tomcat (Navy) and F-15 Eagle (air Force) and later the F-18 Hornet (Navy/Marines) and Harrier Jump Jet (Marines).
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>Success</h4>
			There have been more F4 Phantoms produced than any other supersonic jet ever.  It has had an amazing career for three branches of our military and militaries all over the planet.  Its kill ratio in Vietnam is an unrealistic representation of how and how effectively the F4 could fight.  
		</div>
		<div>
			<H4>Conclusion</H4>
			In conclusion, the F4 was hated for its bloated nature and lack of within-visual-range dogfighting ability.  It was hated for the very idea of a one-plane-fits-all approach to designing an aircraft for the military's branches' many different requirements.  But in the end it was a success.  And it didn't even have the F-35's best and most important qualities...
		</div>
		<ul ID="ZZ">
				<li>Stealth</li>
				<li>Vertical Takeoff and Landing</li>
				<li>Fast/secure links for shared intel</li>
				<li>A great cannon (mostly for tanks and whatnot but also used in visual-range dogfights</li>
				<li>Most important are the first two because it makes every single helicopter carrying vessel into something as capable of attacking Russia or China without worry as a nuclear supercarrier.  How could Russia or China defend against that?</li>
