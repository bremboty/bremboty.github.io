				The F35B has vertical take-off and landing capabilities like a helicopter.  This allows it to be launched from small WASP class aircraft carriers designed usually just for helicopters.  With the ability to launch F-35s, these WASP-class vessels will be able to destroy anti-aircraft missile sites (due to it's stealth) and destroy enemy radar cababilities for hundreds of miles inland.  Paired with Osprey transport vehicles a WASP-class boat can now penetrate the most advanced defenses from sea hundreds of miles inland with little risk.

				There have been a lot of negative reviews about the dogfighting capabilities of the f-35.  It was unable to destroy much older aircraft during tests.  However, the pilots in the older aircraft had over 25,000 hours flight time compared to the 2,000 of the pilot in the f-35.  Also, most importantly, no aircraft has been able to even lock on to an f-35.  This is the real point of the f-35's dogfighting capabilities: the ability to not require an air escort for close support missions the way, say, an a-10 warthog would.  It is able to launch from a small WASP and eliminate radar and SAM targets without air escort.  It is the one tool to rule them all.

				<li>1940's era radar can detect even the most advanced stealth aircraft from a long distance and with accuracy</li>
				<li>these old-style radars are mobile and get more advanced every year </li>
				<li>These radar cannot guide weapons which is why stealth is necessary.  For pilot safety not to avoid detection.</li>
